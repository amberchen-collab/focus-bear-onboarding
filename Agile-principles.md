Main differences between Scrum and Kanban:

Scrum is more structured, with roles, sprints, and regular meetings, while Kanban is more flexible and continuous. Scrum organizes work into time-boxed sprints, but Kanban limits how many tasks can be in progress at once. Scrum works well when projects have clear goals and deadlines, and Kanban is better for ongoing tasks that often change.

One Agile principle I think will be most useful:

“Responding to change over following a plan.” This is useful because my work often shifts depending on feedback or priorities, so being adaptable helps me stay effective.

Observation:

Focus Bear’s GitHub Kanban board is clear, but it can feel a bit technical because it’s built around coding conventions (issues, pull requests, labels). For someone from a non-coding or creative background, this structure might seem complicated at first.

Improvement idea:

One way to improve task tracking is to make the board more user-friendly for non-technical team members. This could mean:

Creating a clear naming format for cards (e.g., “[Platform] – [Task] – [Due Date]”) so they’re easy to scan.

Stand-up Meeting Observation

During the stand-up, each team member gave a short update on what they worked on yesterday, what they’re focusing on today, and if they have any blockers. I noticed the updates were kept brief, but also gave enough context so everyone understood the overall progress.

Retrospective Reflection

In the retrospective notes, the team discussed what went well (clear communication and task ownership), what didn’t go so well (some delays due to unclear priorities), and action points (better use of the Kanban board to track status).

One Change for Better Collaboration

I can make my own updates clearer and more concise by focusing on the outcome of what I did, not just the task itself. This will help others quickly understand how my work connects to the team’s goals and avoid confusion.

My Role in the Agile Team

My role fits into the Agile team by producing and editing content, such as podcast episodes and show notes, and ensuring tasks are updated in the Kanban board. By keeping my work visible and communicating progress during stand-ups, I help the team stay aligned and adapt quickly to changes.

Collaboration with the Marketing Role

I frequently collaborate with the marketing role, especially when writing YouTube descriptions and preparing episode materials. To improve teamwork, I can share drafts earlier so they have more time to review and schedule posts.
