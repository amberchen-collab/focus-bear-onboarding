Main differences between Scrum and Kanban:

Scrum is more structured, with roles, sprints, and regular meetings, while Kanban is more flexible and continuous. Scrum organizes work into time-boxed sprints, but Kanban limits how many tasks can be in progress at once. Scrum works well when projects have clear goals and deadlines, and Kanban is better for ongoing tasks that often change.

One Agile principle I think will be most useful:

“Responding to change over following a plan.” This is useful because my work often shifts depending on feedback or priorities, so being adaptable helps me stay effective.
Observation:

Focus Bear’s GitHub Kanban board is clear, but it can feel a bit technical because it’s built around coding conventions (issues, pull requests, labels). For someone from a non-coding or creative background, this structure might seem complicated at first.

Improvement idea:

One way to improve task tracking is to make the board more user-friendly for non-technical team members. This could mean:

Creating a clear naming format for cards (e.g., “[Platform] – [Task] – [Due Date]”) so they’re easy to scan.
