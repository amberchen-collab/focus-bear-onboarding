Main differences between Scrum and Kanban:

Scrum is more structured, with roles, sprints, and regular meetings, while Kanban is more flexible and continuous. Scrum organizes work into time-boxed sprints, but Kanban limits how many tasks can be in progress at once. Scrum works well when projects have clear goals and deadlines, and Kanban is better for ongoing tasks that often change.

One Agile principle I think will be most useful:

“Responding to change over following a plan.” This is useful because my work often shifts depending on feedback or priorities, so being adaptable helps me stay effective.
