Kanban Board Structure

On the Focus Bear GitHub Projects board, tasks are organized into columns such as To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done. Each task card includes a clear title, description, and often has labels or due dates to show its priority and type of work. This makes it easy to see where each task stands and who is responsible.

Moving a Task

I selected one of my assigned tasks and moved it from In Progress to Review after completing the editing step. Updating the status gave the team visibility that my part was finished and that the task was ready for feedback or approval.

Improvement for Task Tracking

One way I can improve task tracking in my role is by writing more detailed notes in the task description when I update its status. This will help others quickly understand what Iâ€™ve completed, avoid duplicate work, and make reviews more efficient.
